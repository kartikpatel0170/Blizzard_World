# Blizzard_World
- a small project I created form basic concepts to advance concepts of C++

Over the course of the term, you will develop a text-based adventure game loosely inspired by Colossal Cave Adventure, an early computer game. In the game, the player will explore a world in search of treasure. When playing the game, the program will print a description of the player's position, the user will enter a text command, and the program will print the results. This process will be repeated until the game ends.

In Part 1, you will implement a simple version of the game where the player moves around a grid-based version of the world. The focus is on using arrays, including two-dimensional arrays.

In Part 2, you will add items that the player can acquire to score points. The focus is on using structured records.

In Part 3, you will convert your program to use classes. The focus is on data encapsulation. You will also load a different world data file.

In Part 4, you will restructure your program and change the world to have a graph-based representation (instead of a grid-based representation). The focus is on using an object-oriented design technique named composition.

In Part 5, you will load and sort items from a file, which will allow you to easily load a different world data file. You will also add a high scores table. The focus is on pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and linked lists.

In Part 6, you will add obstacles to the world that can be passed by carrying specific items. You will also write some template functions that are not part of the game. The focus is on polymorphism in the forms of interface inheritance (an object-oriented design concept) and templates.
